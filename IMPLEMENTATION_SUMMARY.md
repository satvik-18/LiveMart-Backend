```

### Modified Tables
```sql
products
  - Added: seller_id (INTEGER FK)
  - Added: category (VARCHAR)
  - Added: updated_at (TIMESTAMP)
  - Removed: stock (moved to inventory tables)
  - Removed: product_type (inferred from seller role)
  - Removed: seller (VARCHAR, replaced by seller_id)

orders
  - Added: buyer_id (replaces customer_id)
  - Added: total_amount (NUMERIC)
  - Added: order_type ('retail' | 'wholesale')
  - Updated: Comprehensive tracking
```

### Indexes Added
```sql
- idx_products_seller
- idx_products_category

```

## 🔧 Business Logic Implemented

### Supply Chain Rules
✅ Wholesalers → Retailers (bulk only, min 10 units)
✅ Retailers → Customers (retail)
✅ Customers cannot buy from wholesalers
✅ Wholesalers cannot place orders (suppliers only)

### Inventory Management
✅ Separate stock tracking per seller
✅ Low stock alerts for retailers
✅ Bulk order minimums for wholesalers
✅ Automatic inventory updates on orders
✅ Transaction-safe stock transfers

### Validation
✅ Minimum order quantity enforcement
✅ Stock availability checks
✅ Role-based access control
✅ Ownership verification
✅ Prevent self-ordering
